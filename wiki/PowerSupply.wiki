You want a 5V DC power source, with at least 500mA (which should probably cover up to 16 synths, I think). Connect the positive +5V to the red lane on your breadboard (or whatever you are using as the positive supply line). Connect the Ground to the black/blue lanes. If you look at my example setup photo above, you'll see that I have the power and ground lanes connected throughout. I connected the power source at the top left.
