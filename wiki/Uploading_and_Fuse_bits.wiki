#summary You need to set fuse bits to allow an external crystal oscillator.

= Introduction =

Before your programmer can talk to your AVR microcontroller, you probably need to set the AVR Fuse bits (basic settings of how the MCU operates) so it will look for an external crystal oscillator. The program expects to be running at 20 Mhz.


= Details =

Fuse bits:

High byte = 0xDF
Low byte = 0xFF
Extended fuse (optional -- probably already set) = 0x01
