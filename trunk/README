4bitsynth is a MIDI-controlled digital synthesizer that uses the Atmel AVR ATMega48. The inspiration is from the NES. As such, the sound is 4-bit. The 4-bit digital output is put through an R-2R resistor ladder to get the analog waveform.

Building instructions and schematic are available at the wiki:
